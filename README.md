## What I learnt
The purpose of the project was to practice using Object constructors.
I decided to try using BEM methodology and it felt a whole easier writing css especially when I combined it with sass.

I also implemented a dark mode feature. This was my first time implemeting dark mode. It was suprisingly easier than i thought.
I used CSS custom properties to store color values for both light and dark, then switching the theme was just toggling classes with JavaScript.
